        <h1>My Saturday</h1>
        
        <p>Yesterday was boring because I had to wake up early in the morning and go to school. I did not want to go therr but the I had no but to attend as we had a test to write. It was rainy and so my aunt took me to school because I accidentally broke my umbrella.After school? Yoh,we got out a bit later and my aunt had already went to work so she couldn't come to pick me up. By that time there were no taxis so my friend and I had to squeeze in under her tiny umbrella and walk home. I then asked Thato(my friend) for us to pass by our primary schoolmate's house and ask him to borrow us his umbrella, because we had to part ways along the way. We got the umbrella and when I got home, I went straight to bed because it was very cold. Luckily we did not have <b>Coding lessons</b> so I slept like nobody's business.</p>
