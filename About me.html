        <p1>I chose the Mathematics and Science stream because I want to study medicine and cardiology and it requires the stream I am currently doing.I also chose this stream because I love biology(Life Sciences) so bad.I also love Pure maths,so those are the reasons why I chose this stream.</p1>

            <p1>One of my favourite cars is Mercedes Benz GLE. I don't really have a reason why I love this car but I just felt in love with it at first sight. My other favourite car is BMW M4, it's sound made me love it and the way it's built is just top tier. Audi R8 is also my favourite car because it's nice and I love well-built it is.I also love mercedes benz G-Wagon because it has enough space for family trips and it can also control its wheels which makes it easieer to avoid accidents. I also love Rolce Royce because it has sensors and can sense if there's someone on the way, and therefore stops itself.</p>
